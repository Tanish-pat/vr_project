      {
        "question": "Based on the image, what seems to be the function of the material surrounding the individual wires within the cable?",
        "answer": "Insulation"
      },
      {
        "question": "From the image's cross-section, what appears to be the general form of the internal wire arrangement within the cable?",
        "answer": "Bundled"
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the visual representation suggest any visible signs of damage or fraying to the cable shown?",
